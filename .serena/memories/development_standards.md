# Development Standards for CreatorFlow

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy
1. Use feature branches for all new development: `feature/description`
2. Branch off from `main` for new features
3. Keep feature branches focused on a single, well-defined piece of work
4. Delete feature branches after merging

### Commit Messages
1. Follow conventional commit message format when possible
2. Write clear, concise commit messages in present tense
3. Use the following structure:
   ```
   type(scope): brief description
   
   More detailed explanation if needed (optional)
   ```
   Types include: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, test, perf

### Pull Requests
1. Create pull requests for all feature branches
2. Ensure PRs are focused and don't include unrelated changes
3. Request review from team members
4. Address all review comments before merging
5. Merge using squash and merge to maintain a clean commit history

## Code Review Standards

### Review Process
1. At least one team member should review each PR
2. Reviewers should check for:
   - Code quality and adherence to style guide
   - Correctness and efficiency of implementation
   - Test coverage for new features
   - Documentation updates
   - Security considerations

### Reviewer Responsibilities
1. Provide constructive feedback
2. Approve only when satisfied with the changes
3. Ensure the code follows project conventions
4. Verify tests are adequate and passing

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
1. Write unit tests for all new functions and components
2. Maintain high test coverage (aim for >80%)
3. Use Jest for unit testing
4. Place test files adjacent to the code they're testing

### E2E Tests
1. Write E2E tests for critical user flows
2. Use Playwright for E2E testing
3. Place E2E tests in the tests/e2e directory

### Test Execution
1. Run all tests before submitting a PR:
   ```bash
   bun test && bun run test:e2e
   ```

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
1. Use JSDoc/TypeDoc comments for functions, classes, and complex logic
2. Document public APIs and interfaces
3. Keep comments up to date with code changes

### Project Documentation
1. Update relevant documentation in the docs/ directory when making feature changes
2. Follow the documentation standards in docs/development/documentation-standards/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md
3. Ensure README.md is updated for any setup or usage changes

## Security Practices

### Credential Management
1. Never commit credentials or API keys to the repository
2. Use environment variables for configuration
3. Follow the .env.local.example pattern for new configuration variables

### Dependency Management
1. Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
2. Review dependencies before adding new ones
3. Use npm audit or similar tools to identify vulnerabilities

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
1. Profile performance for critical paths
2. Implement code splitting where appropriate
3. Optimize images and other assets
4. Minimize bundle size

### Monitoring
1. Use performance monitoring tools in production
2. Set up alerts for performance regressions
3. Regularly review performance metrics

## Deployment Standards

### Continuous Integration
1. Ensure all CI checks pass before merging
2. Set up appropriate CI pipelines for testing and building
3. Use automated deployment when possible

### Release Process
1. Follow semantic versioning
2. Create release tags for production deployments
3. Document release notes for each version
