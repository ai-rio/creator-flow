## Workflow State Machine Design

### Order State Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> received: TikTok Webhook
    received --> validated: Data Validation
    validated --> processing: Business Rules
    processing --> inventory_reserved: Stock Check
    inventory_reserved --> label_generated: Shipping Label
    label_generated --> shipped: Carrier Pickup
    shipped --> delivered: Delivery Confirmed
    
    received --> failed: Validation Error
    validated --> cancelled: Customer Cancel
    processing --> failed: Processing Error
    inventory_reserved --> failed: Stock Unavailable
    label_generated --> failed: Label Error
