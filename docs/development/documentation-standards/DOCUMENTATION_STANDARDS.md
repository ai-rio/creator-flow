# Project Documentation Standards

## Overview

This document defines the official documentation standards for CreatorFlow, ensuring consistent, maintainable, and discoverable documentation across the entire project. All documentation must follow these standards and the **MoSCoW agile methodology**.

## Documentation Architecture

### Four-Category Structure

All documentation initiatives must follow this structure:

```
docs/development/[initiative-name]/
├── 00-planning/          # Investigation and planning documents
├── 01-specifications/    # Technical requirements and specs
├── 02-implementation/    # Implementation progress and guides
└── 03-reports/          # Final reports and retrospectives
```

### File Naming Convention

| Category | Prefix | Format | Example |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| Planning | P### | `P001-initiative-investigation.md` | `P001-tiktok-shop-investigation.md` |
| Specifications | S### | `S001-technical-requirements.md` | `S001-api-integration-specs.md` |
| Implementation | I### | `I001-DRAFT-implementation-progress.md` | `I001-DRAFT-api-integration-progress.md` |
| Reports | R### | `R001-DRAFT-final-report.md` | `R001-DRAFT-integration-report.md` |

## MoSCoW Methodology Integration

### Mandatory MoSCoW Application

- Advanced reporting
- Third-party integrations

#### **Won't Have (W)** - Out of Scope
- Full e-commerce platform

## Diagram Standards

### Mermaid Diagrams

Use Mermaid for all technical diagrams:

#### System Architecture
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Frontend"
        UI[Next.js UI]
        API[API Routes]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend"
        DB[(Supabase)]
        Auth[Authentication]
    end
    
    subgraph "External"
        TikTok[TikTok Shop API]
        Stripe[Stripe API]
    end
    
    UI --> API
    API --> DB
    API --> Auth
    API --> TikTok
    API --> Stripe
```

#### Data Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant CF as CreatorFlow
    participant TS as TikTok Shop
    participant S as Stripe
    
    U->>CF: Connect TikTok Shop
    CF->>TS: OAuth Request
    TS->>CF: Access Token
    CF->>TS: Fetch Orders
    TS->>CF: Order Data
    CF->>S: Process Payment
    S->>CF: Payment Confirmed
    CF->>U: Order Processed
```

#### Database Schema
```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o{ SHOPS : owns
    SHOPS ||--o{ ORDERS : contains
    ORDERS ||--o{ ORDER_ITEMS : includes
    USERS {
        uuid id PK
        string email
        string name
        timestamp created_at
    }
    SHOPS {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        string tiktok_shop_id
        string access_token
        timestamp connected_at
    }
```

## Quality Gates

### Documentation Review Checklist

- [ ] **Follows Documentation Standards**: Uses proper structure and naming
- [ ] **MoSCoW Prioritization**: Includes proper prioritization
- [ ] **Technical Accuracy**: Information is correct and up-to-date
- [ ] **Completeness**: All required sections are present
- [ ] **Clarity**: Content is clear and understandable
- [ ] **Diagrams**: Includes relevant technical diagrams
- [ ] **Links**: All internal links work correctly
- [ ] **DRAFT Status**: Implementation docs use DRAFT prefix until approved

### Approval Process

1. **Creation**: Author creates document with DRAFT prefix
2. **Review**: Technical review by team members
3. **Validation**: User acceptance testing (for implementation docs)
4. **Approval**: Remove DRAFT prefix after validation
5. **Maintenance**: Regular updates and reviews

## Prohibited Practices

❌ **Never Do**:
- Create documentation in project root
- Claim implementation is "COMPLETE" without validation
- Skip MoSCoW prioritization
- Use inconsistent naming conventions
- Create final reports before user testing

✅ **Always Do**:
- Use four-category structure
- Include MoSCoW prioritization
- Add relevant diagrams
- Link to related documentation
- Wait for validation before removing DRAFT prefix
