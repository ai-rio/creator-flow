#### Next Steps
1. Design alerting rules and thresholds
2. Implement low stock detection logic
3. Create email and in-app notification systems

### Phase 5: API Development (Weeks 9-10)

#### Tasks
- [ ] Implement inventory query endpoints
- [ ] Implement inventory update endpoints
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization
- [ ] Implement request validation
- [ ] Add rate limiting

#### Status
- Query endpoints: NOT STARTED
- Update endpoints: NOT STARTED
- Auth implementation: NOT STARTED
- Request validation: NOT STARTED
- Rate limiting: NOT STARTED

#### Next Steps
1. Design API endpoint structure
2. Implement basic inventory query endpoints
3. Add authentication and authorization

### Phase 6: UI Components (Weeks 11-12)

#### Tasks
- [ ] Design inventory dashboard
- [ ] Create product inventory view
- [ ] Implement inventory adjustment UI
- [ ] Add low stock alert display
- [ ] Create inventory history view

#### Status
- Dashboard design: NOT STARTED
- Product view: NOT STARTED
- Adjustment UI: NOT STARTED
- Alert display: NOT STARTED
- History view: NOT STARTED

#### Next Steps
1. Create UI wireframes for inventory components
2. Implement basic inventory dashboard
3. Add product inventory view with stock levels

## Current Sprint (Sprint 1)

### Goals
1. Complete database schema design
2. Create initial database migration
3. Set up development environment for inventory tracking

### Tasks
- [ ] Finalize database schema
- [ ] Create migration scripts
- [ ] Apply migrations to development database
- [ ] Set up local TikTok Shop testing environment

### Status
- Schema finalization: NOT STARTED
- Migration creation: NOT STARTED
- Database application: NOT STARTED
- Testing environment: NOT STARTED

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks

1. **TikTok Shop API Rate Limiting**
   - Risk: API rate limits could prevent real-time inventory sync
   - Mitigation: Implement intelligent polling with exponential backoff

2. **Data Consistency During Concurrent Updates**
   - Risk: Simultaneous updates could cause inventory discrepancies
   - Mitigation: Use database transactions and locking mechanisms

3. **High-Volume Performance**
   - Risk: Large catalogs may cause performance issues
   - Mitigation: Implement efficient querying and caching strategies

### Business Risks

1. **Creator Adoption**
   - Risk: Creators may not understand the value of inventory tracking
   - Mitigation: Create educational materials and onboarding flows

2. **Competition**
   - Risk: Competitors may release similar features
   - Mitigation: Focus on superior user experience and automation

## Resource Requirements

### Engineering
- 2 backend engineers (80% time for 12 weeks)
- 1 frontend engineer (50% time for 12 weeks)
- 1 QA engineer (30% time for 12 weeks)

### Infrastructure
- Additional database storage for inventory transactions
- Monitoring for new API endpoints
- Alerting for system failures

## Testing Plan

### Unit Testing
- Target: 90% code coverage for inventory services
- Framework: Jest for backend, React Testing Library for frontend
- Timeline: Ongoing throughout development

### Integration Testing
- Target: Test all integration points with TikTok Shop and order system
- Framework: Jest with mock APIs
- Timeline: After each integration is implemented

### Performance Testing
- Target: Validate performance with 10K+ SKU catalogs
- Tools: Custom load testing scripts
- Timeline: Before Phase 1 completion

### User Acceptance Testing
- Target: Validate with 5-10 beta creators
- Timeline: 2 weeks before planned release
