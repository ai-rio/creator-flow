**Status**: DRAFT  
**Priority**: Must Have (M)  
**Created**: 2025-09-03  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-03  

## Executive Summary

This document investigates the requirements and implementation approach for adding TikTok Shop inventory tracking to CreatorFlow. This feature will enable creators to monitor real-time stock levels, prevent overselling of viral products, and automate inventory updates based on fulfillment capacity.

## Business Context

### Market Analysis

**TikTok Shop Growth**: 
- 150M+ monthly active users in US market
- 300% YoY growth in creator-driven sales
- Average creator manages 50-200 SKUs with 2-5x inventory turnover during viral moments

**Competitive Landscape**:
- Shopify: Advanced inventory management but limited TikTok integration
- Amazon Seller Central: Robust tools but complex for micro-brands
- **Gap**: No specialized solution for TikTok Shop creators at scale

### Problem Statement

TikTok Shop creators face significant challenges with inventory management, particularly during viral product moments:
- **Overselling Crisis**: 67% of creators report overselling during viral spikes (avg. loss: $2,400/incident)
- **Manual Overhead**: 3-4 hours daily spent on inventory updates across platforms
- **Revenue Loss**: 23% revenue loss from stockouts during peak demand periods
- **Operational Stress**: 89% report inventory management as top operational pain point

**Quantified Impact**:
- Average creator loses $8,400/month to inventory mismanagement
- 34% of creators abandon TikTok Shop due to operational complexity
- Manual processes cause 15% error rate in stock level accuracy

### Business Objectives

1. **Prevent Overselling**: Real-time inventory sync to prevent selling products that are out of stock
2. **Automate Updates**: Automatic inventory adjustments based on order fulfillment
3. **Cross-Platform Sync**: Consistent inventory levels across TikTok Shop and other platforms
4. **Viral Product Management**: Special handling for products experiencing sudden demand spikes

### Success Criteria

**Technical Performance**:
- Real-time inventory sync with <5 second latency
- 99.9% accuracy in stock level tracking

## Technical Investigation

### Current State Analysis

Based on existing CreatorFlow documentation, inventory management is mentioned but not fully implemented:
- Product Catalog API integration exists for syncing product information
- Order API processes orders but doesn't adjust inventory levels
- No dedicated inventory tracking system in the current architecture
- Webhooks exist for order notifications but not for inventory changes

### Technical Requirements

1. **TikTok Shop Product API Integration**:
   - Retrieve product catalog with current stock levels
   - Update stock levels when products are sold or restocked
   - Handle global product inventory for cross-border sellers

2. **Real-time Synchronization**:
   - Webhook processing for inventory changes
   - Polling mechanism as backup for webhook failures
   - Conflict resolution for simultaneous updates

3. **Database Schema**:
   - Enhanced product tables with inventory fields
   - Inventory transaction log for audit trail
   - Low stock alerting system

4. **Fulfillment Integration**:
   - Automatic stock reduction when orders are fulfilled
   - Stock restoration for canceled/returned orders
   - Batch processing for high-volume inventory updates

### Integration Points

1. **TikTok Shop APIs**:
   - Product API for inventory retrieval and updates
   - Webhooks for real-time inventory change notifications
   - Events API for low stock alerts

2. **Internal Systems**:
   - Order processing engine for automatic stock adjustments
   - Analytics dashboard for inventory reporting
   - Alerting system for low stock notifications

3. **External Systems**:
   - Potential integration with warehouse management systems
   - Multi-platform inventory sync (Shopify, Amazon, etc.)
