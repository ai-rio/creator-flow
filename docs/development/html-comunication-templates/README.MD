**Status:** Definitive

**Last Updated:** September 9, 2025

## **1.0 Executive Summary**

This document is the single source of truth for the CreatorFlow email communication ecosystem. It outlines the strategic architecture, the definitive naming convention, and the purpose of every email artifact designed to manage the full creator lifecycle. The architecture is built on the "Definitive" standard, with a core brand voice of the "Empowered Sage."

The ecosystem is organized into three distinct pillars, each with a unique purpose, voice, and design language. This separation ensures that every communication a user receives is clear, purposeful, and reinforces the CreatorFlow brand.

## **2.0 The Definitive Naming Convention**

All email artifacts are classified under a three-pillar taxonomy. This naming convention provides immediate context for the email's purpose and must be strictly adhered to.

* **SC- // System Communications:** Triggered, functional emails related to the user's account state and system events. The voice is a direct "System Advisory." The design is a rigid, color-coded system for at-a-glance state recognition.  
* **MC- // Marketing Communications:** Broadcast emails designed to nurture the user relationship, announce new capabilities, and provide strategic intelligence. The voice is the "Empowered Sage" as a market analyst. The design is premium and editorial.  
* **CC- // Content Communications:** Broadcast emails that deliver in-depth strategic content (blog posts, case studies) to establish thought leadership. The voice is the "Empowered Sage" as a master strategist. The design is focused on long-form readability.
