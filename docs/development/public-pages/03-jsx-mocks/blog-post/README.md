# **CreatorFlow: The "Double AAA+" Strategic Content Arsenal**

This directory contains the complete suite of "Double AAA+" strategic content artifacts forged for the CreatorFlow project. Each component in this library is not merely a piece of UI; it is a living, interactive instrument of command, built to the highest possible standard of aesthetic, functional, and strategic excellence.

## **Core Philosophy: "Flying Fly Dead"**

The guiding principle for every artifact in this collection is **"Flying Fly Dead."** This protocol dictates that execution must be indistinguishable from perfection. Each component has been architected and forged to a "Double AAA+" standard, representing a new baseline for high-fidelity, interactive web experiences.

## **Naming Convention: The Artifact Protocol**

All components adhere to a strict naming convention to ensure clarity, organization, and strategic alignment.

**Format:** AC-ComponentName.jsx

- **AC- Prefix**: Stands for **"Artifact of Command."** This designates the component as a strategic instrument, not just a UI element.
- **ComponentName**: The core name of the artifact, expressed in PascalCase (e.g., DataTable, ArticleHero).
