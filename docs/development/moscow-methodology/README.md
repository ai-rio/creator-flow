# MoSCoW Methodology for CreatorFlow

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This document outlines the MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) prioritization methodology for CreatorFlow's development roadmap and feature planning.

## ðŸŽ¯ MoSCoW Categories

### **Must Have** (Critical for MVP)
Features that are absolutely essential for the product to work and deliver core value.

### **Should Have** (Important but not critical)
Features that are important and add significant value but the product can function without them initially.

### **Could Have** (Nice to have)
Features that would be nice to include if time and resources permit, but are not essential.

### **Won't Have** (Not in this iteration)
Features that are explicitly excluded from the current scope but may be considered for future releases.

## ðŸ“Š Documentation Structure

All MoSCoW documentation follows the four-category structure:

- **00-planning/**: Initial MoSCoW analysis and prioritization
- **01-specifications/**: Detailed requirements for each category
- **02-implementation/**: Development progress tracking
- **03-reports/**: Status reports and retrospectives
