**Document Type**: Planning  
**Status**: DRAFT

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-04  

## Executive Summary

Investigation into multi-language support for CreatorFlow platform targeting Portuguese (Brazil), English (US), and Spanish (Latin America) markets. Research indicates `next-intl` as optimal solution for Next.js 15 App Router with 8-week implementation timeline.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
CreatorFlow currently supports English only, limiting market expansion in high-growth TikTok Shop regions including Brazil (215M population) and Spanish LATAM (400M+ speakers).

### Business Objectives
- Expand user acquisition in target markets
- Reduce customer acquisition costs through localization
- Establish foundation for global expansion

### Success Criteria
- 200% user acquisition increase in target markets
- 15% conversion rate improvement in localized markets
- Zero locale-specific production bugs

## Technical Investigation

### Current State Analysis
- Next.js 15 App Router architecture
- No existing i18n implementation
- English-only UI and content
- Single currency/date format support

### Technical Requirements
- Locale-based routing (`/en`, `/pt-br`, `/es`)
- Translation management system
- Cultural formatting (dates, currency, numbers)
- SEO optimization per locale

### Integration Points
- TikTok Shop API (multi-region support)
- Stripe payments (currency handling)
- Email templates (Resend integration)
- Analytics tracking (PostHog)

## MoSCoW Prioritization

### Must Have (M)
- [ ] Core UI translation (navigation, forms, buttons)
- [ ] Order management localization
- [ ] Authentication flow translation
- [ ] Basic date/currency formatting

### Should Have (S)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard localization
- [ ] Email template translation
- [ ] Professional translation review
- [ ] E2E testing for all locales

### Could Have (C)

## Recommendations

### Proposed Approach
**Library**: `next-intl` (v3.x)
- Native Next.js 15 support
- Server Components compatibility
- Type-safe translations
- Static generation optimization

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Foundation setup
- **Week 3-4**: Core features
- **Week 5-6**: Advanced features  
- **Week 7-8**: Testing and optimization

### Resource Requirements
- Frontend Developer: 40 hours/week for 8 weeks
- Translation Services: 500+ strings
- QA Testing: 20 hours locale-specific testing

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create technical specifications document
- [ ] Setup development environment for i18n
- [ ] Begin translation key inventory
- [ ] Research professional translation services
