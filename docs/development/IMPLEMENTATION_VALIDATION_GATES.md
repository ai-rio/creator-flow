# Implementation Validation Gates

**Purpose**: Enforce implementation-first approach and prevent documentation drift.

## Validation Rules

### DRAFT Removal Requirements

**No DRAFT prefix removal without**:
1. ✅ Working code demonstration
2. ✅ Passing tests (unit + integration)  
3. ✅ User validation/testing
4. ✅ Performance targets met

### Documentation Budget

**Maximum Ratios**:
- Spec-to-Code: 2:1 (max 2 pages spec per implemented feature)
- Planning-to-Implementation: 20:80 time allocation
- DRAFT Age: 4 weeks maximum before implementation proof required

### Phase Gating

**Phase 1 (Must Have) - ACTIVE**:
- TikTok Shop Integration
- Order Management Core  
- Authentication Foundation
- Basic Dashboard
- Localization MVP (3 languages only)

**Phase 2 (Should Have) - BLOCKED until Phase 1 complete**:
- Advanced analytics
- Multi-carrier shipping
- Workflow automation

**Phase 3 (Could Have) - ARCHIVED**:
- AI features
- White-label solutions
- Enterprise features

## Weekly Review Process

### Implementation Review (Every Monday)
1. Count lines of code vs. lines of documentation
2. Validate DRAFT age compliance
3. Check implementation proof for spec approvals
4. Archive outdated investigations

### Success Metrics
- Implementation-to-Documentation Ratio: >1:2
- DRAFT Document Age: <4 weeks  
- Validation Gate Compliance: 100%
- Redundancy Index: <10%

## Enforcement Actions

**DRAFT Age Violations**:
- Week 4: Implementation plan required
- Week 6: Archive to future backlog
- Week 8: Delete if no progress

**Redundancy Violations**:
- Immediate consolidation required
- Single source of truth enforcement
- Cross-reference cleanup

## Current Status Dashboard

**Phase 1 Systems**:
- [ ] TikTok Integration: Spec ready → START IMPLEMENTATION
- [ ] Order Management: Consolidated → START IMPLEMENTATION  
- [ ] Authentication: Needs consolidation
- [ ] Dashboard: Needs wireframe consolidation
- [ ] Localization: Needs scope reduction

**Action Required**: Begin implementation of consolidated order management spec immediately.
