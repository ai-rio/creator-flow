# P001: QuoteKit Infrastructure Audit & Migration Planning

**Document Type**: Planning  
**Status**: DRAFT  
**Created**: 2025-09-02  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-02  

## Executive Summary

This document audits the infrastructure components in QuoteKit that could be leveraged for CreatorFlow, analyzes their suitability, and plans a strategic migration approach that aligns with CreatorFlow's specific requirements.

## Audit Scope

### Infrastructure Components Identified in QuoteKit

#### 1. Stripe Integration
**Location**: `/src/libs/stripe/`, `/scripts/sync-stripe*`, `/src/constants/stripe-prices.ts`
**Components**:
- Stripe client configuration
- Subscription management
- Webhook handling
- Price synchronization scripts
- Error handling utilities

**Assessment**: 
- ✅ Core Stripe patterns are reusable
- ⚠️ Product/pricing structure needs CreatorFlow customization
- ⚠️ Webhook endpoints need creator-specific logic

#### 2. Supabase Integration
**Location**: `/src/libs/supabase/`, `/supabase/`
**Components**:
- Database client configurations
- RLS policies
- Edge functions
- Type generation
- Migration system

**Assessment**:
- ✅ Client patterns are directly reusable
- ❌ Database schema is QuoteKit-specific
- ❌ RLS policies need complete redesign for creator workflows

#### 3. Authentication System
**Location**: `/src/features/auth/`, `/src/app/(auth)/`
**Components**:
- Supabase Auth integration
- Session management
- Protected routes
- User management

**Assessment**:
- ✅ Auth patterns are standard and reusable
- ⚠️ User roles need creator-specific customization

#### 4. Email System
**Location**: `/src/features/emails/`
**Components**:
- React Email templates
- Resend integration
- Email sending utilities

**Assessment**:
- ✅ Email infrastructure is reusable
- ❌ Templates are QuoteKit-specific
- ✅ Sending patterns can be adapted

#### 5. Testing Infrastructure
**Location**: `/tests/`, `/playwright.config.ts`, `/jest.config.js`
**Components**:
- Playwright E2E setup
- Jest unit testing
- Test helpers and mocks
- CI/CD testing scripts

**Assessment**:
- ✅ Testing patterns are directly reusable
- ⚠️ Test data needs creator-flow scenarios

## CreatorFlow-Specific Requirements Analysis

### Core Business Logic Differences

| Component | QuoteKit Focus | CreatorFlow Focus | Migration Strategy |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Payments** | Quote-based billing | Creator subscription tiers | Adapt pricing structure |
| **Users** | Business quotes | TikTok creators | New user schema |
| **Orders** | Quote requests | TikTok Shop orders | Complete redesign |
| **Analytics** | Quote metrics | Creator performance | New analytics schema |
| **Integrations** | Quote tools | TikTok Shop API | New integration layer |

### Technical Architecture Alignment

#### Compatible Components
- Stripe subscription management patterns
- Supabase client configuration
- Authentication flow structure
- Email sending infrastructure
- Testing framework setup

#### Incompatible Components
- Database schema (completely different domain)
- Business logic (quotes vs creator fulfillment)
- API endpoints (different data models)
- UI components (different user workflows)

## Migration Strategy Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure (Safe to Copy)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Risk**: Low

```bash
# Safe to copy directly
- Stripe client configuration patterns
- Supabase client setup
- Authentication utilities
- Email sending infrastructure
- Testing framework configuration
```

### Phase 2: Customized Infrastructure (Adapt & Modify)
**Timeline**: 3-5 days  
**Risk**: Medium

```bash
# Requires customization
- Stripe product/pricing configuration
- Database schema design
- RLS policies for creator workflows
- Email templates for creator scenarios
- Test data for creator use cases
```

### Phase 3: Creator-Specific Implementation (Build New)
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Risk**: High

```bash
# Build from scratch
- TikTok Shop API integration
- Creator order management
- Shipping provider integrations
- Creator analytics system
- Creator-specific UI components
```

## Recommended Approach

### 1. Infrastructure Audit Checklist

- [ ] **Stripe Integration Analysis**
  - [ ] Review subscription models compatibility
  - [ ] Analyze webhook handling patterns
  - [ ] Assess pricing structure adaptability

- [ ] **Supabase Integration Analysis**
  - [ ] Review client configuration patterns
  - [ ] Analyze RLS policy structure
  - [ ] Assess migration system compatibility

- [ ] **Authentication System Analysis**
  - [ ] Review auth flow patterns
  - [ ] Analyze user management structure
  - [ ] Assess role-based access patterns

### 2. Risk Assessment

#### High Risk Areas
- Database schema migration (complete redesign needed)
- Business logic adaptation (different domain models)
- Integration endpoints (TikTok vs Quote APIs)

#### Low Risk Areas
- Client configuration patterns
- Authentication infrastructure
- Email sending utilities
- Testing framework setup

### 3. Success Criteria

- [ ] CreatorFlow maintains independent codebase
- [ ] No QuoteKit-specific business logic in CreatorFlow
- [ ] All infrastructure components work with creator workflows
- [ ] Testing coverage maintained during migration
- [ ] Documentation follows CreatorFlow standards

## Next Steps

1. **Create Specifications Document** (S001)
   - Detail exact components to migrate
   - Define customization requirements
   - Specify creator-flow adaptations

2. **Create Implementation Plan** (I001-DRAFT)
   - Step-by-step migration process
   - Testing strategy for each component
   - Rollback procedures

3. **Execute Controlled Migration**
   - Start with low-risk components
   - Test each component independently
   - Document any issues or adaptations needed

## Dependencies

- QuoteKit codebase access (✅ Available)
- CreatorFlow development environment (✅ Ready)
- Understanding of creator workflow requirements (⚠️ Needs clarification)
- TikTok Shop API documentation (❓ To be reviewed)

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Infrastructure incompatibility | High | Medium | Thorough testing of each component |
| Business logic contamination | High | Low | Strict separation of concerns |
| Development timeline impact | Medium | Medium | Phased migration approach |
| Testing coverage gaps | Medium | Low | Comprehensive test migration |
